# esprima-walk

A very fast [esprima](http://esprima.org/) AST node walker with no dependencies.

To naÃ¯vely traverse the AST object with callbacks and without knowing its structure will result in an exponential explosion of function calls and could take several seconds for a single parsed file of a thousand or so lines.

**esprima-walk** calls no functions itself, only the callback passed in, and it doesn't invoke the callback on every property and value, only on primary nodes of the tree - those with a `type` property, corresponding to Node objects in the parser API. It also uses the fastest possible ways (on V8) to check types and iterate over properties and arrays.

The normal `require( 'esprima-walk' ).walk` method (also available as just `require( 'esprima-walk' )`) does not change the AST. It has no return value.

A method `require( 'esprima-walk' ).walkAddParent` is also available to add a `.parent` property to every node before invoking the callback on it. If a node has a parent, all of its ancestors will have a `.parent` property at that point too. The root node will have no `.parent` property.

## Usage

```js
var esprima = require( 'esprima' )
var walk = require( 'esprima-walk' )

var ast = esprima.parse( '"orange"' )

ast => {
    type: 'Program',
    body: [
        {
            type: 'ExpressionStatement',
            expression: {
                type: 'Literal',
                value: 'orange',
                raw: '"orange"'
            }
        }
    ]
}

var types = []

walk( ast, function ( node ) { types.push( node.type ) } )

types => [ 'Program', 'ExpressionStatement', 'Literal' ]
```
